Abstract :
To developed mobile application which reduces the amount of food wastage produced 
in the functions, restaurants and in the mess. The application features the donation of food 
collection of food and direct contact with the nearby NGOs. For Donation of Food following 
needs to be provided such as food details, location of where excess food is available, type and 
also the quantity of food available. Immediate Alerts to nearby NGOs, orphanage, volunteers 
to collect them. According to the recent survey, 1.3 billion tons of food are wasted each year 
and only one third of the food is consumed. This application reduces the amount of wastage of 
food. It also enables the direct contact with the NGOs and volunteers with details of the 
availability of the food.
Introduction :
In countries like India 795 million, out of the world population of 7.6 billion 
people, don’t have enough food to lead a healthy or they are undernourished. That is 
approximately one out of nine people on earth. The reasons can be; firstly, that there is a
shortfall in the food produced worldwide or second, there is massive food wastage phenomenon 
occurring. Looking further into these reasons, today the world is yielding one and half times 
more for an individual, roughly that is enough to feed close to 10 billion people. Despite this 
massive number, people across the globe don’t have sufficient food, to conclude we can say 
that the food produced for the consumption of people is being intentionally or unintentionally 
wasted. Food waste is an ethical issue of global scale. According to the Food and Agriculture 
Organization (FAO) of the United Nations, roughly one-third of all the food produced 
worldwide each year, for human consumptions is either lost or wasted.
A short survey was undertaken by asking relatives, friends, close friends, neighbors, 
and a couple of more people about their experience of donating food. By doing so, it was found 
that earlier, almost a decade back, there was an issue in donating food as there were no food 
banks and NGOs. But then, there came platforms like food banks. Overcoming the limitations 
of the Food Banks, finding an opportunity to make a start-up, there came in a model: a food 
web management system.
 
 Every piece of food wasted is an opportunity lost to improve world hunger and global 
food security. To define food waste, it means food supplies (grains, vegetables, poultry, & 
meat) or drinks which was predetermined to feed people now lies in landfills as garbage despite 
it being fit for human consumption. The food thrown is either spoiled or expired chiefly due to 
economic behavior, poor stock management and neglect. This is happening is developed, 
developing and underdeveloped countries with each’s contribution higher than the other.
Tech-Stack used :--

• Hibernate
• MySQL
• Spring Security (JWT)

Tools and Technologies
Technology Stack for Hunger Help
1. Spring Boot: Utilized to develop the backend of the application, providing a robust framework 
for building Java-based web applications with ease. It ensures smooth integration with various 
components and manages application configurations.
2. Spring Data JPA: Implemented for data access, allowing seamless interaction with the MySQL 
Aiven cloud database to store and retrieve critical data efficiently. It simplifies database 
operations and provides a high-level abstraction for persistence management.
3. RESTful Web Services: Facilitates communication between the frontend and backend 
components of the Hunger Help application. Adhering to the principles of Representational State 
Transfer (REST), these services provide a standardized, stateless approach for building web 
services, ensuring efficient data exchange.
4. Spring Web: Handles web requests and responses, manages controllers, and serves static 
resources to the frontend. It ensures seamless interaction between the user's browser and the 
server.
5. MySQL Database: Chosen as the relational database management system for storing user data, 
food resources, donation information, and other critical application data. 
6. JWT (JSON Web Tokens): Implemented for secure user authentication and authorization. JWT 
ensures that only authenticated users can access certain features and functionalities within the 
Hunger Help application.
7. CSS: Utilized for structuring and styling the frontend components. CSS (with utility-first 
classes) enables rapid prototyping and customization of the user interface.
8. Git: Implemented as a version control system to track changes in the source code, enabling 
collaboration among developers and facilitating code management and deployment workflows.

Future Scope
 From the research, we understood that people are trying to move more towards 
donating food via food waste management web application, as it saves time from searching 
online for different websites and collecting Orphanages contact information and is much faster. 
We would also like to expand our project by adding more platforms like contacting delivery 
companies for collection of food, etc. Another feature that sounds demanding is to show the 
live location of delivery of food. To simplify, our system shall offer a faster booking process 
and faster response to user demand which will saves time of the user.

Conclusion
 Food waste remains a significant issue due to the global food system's focus on profit 
and control, which fosters overproduction and waste. The "Hunger Help" web application
addresses this by connecting donors with NGOs to collect and distribute excess food to those 
in need. It features a responsive interface, efficient database integration and aiming to improve 
food recovery and support effective redistribution. To tackle food waste comprehensively, 
systemic changes are needed to create more sustainable and equitable food systems.
